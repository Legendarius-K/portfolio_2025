      <p>
        I’m a frontend developer with expertise in React, Next.js, TypeScript,
        and React Native. I love building scalable, responsive, and
        user-friendly applications with an eye for detail and performance
        optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I’m developing Nenda’s customer portal app, where I manage
        frontend architecture, API integrations, and TypeScript-heavy logic. I
        have also worked on web projects for Parking Time and Trygg Tandvård,
        focusing on clean, maintainable code and intuitive user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a background in music production, I bring a creative and structured
        approach to problem-solving. I thrive in agile environments, enjoy
        working in cross-functional teams, and always seek opportunities to
        learn and improve.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s build something great together!</p>
